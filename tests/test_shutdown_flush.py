PatchRadar — the spinner must leave nothing in Rich's buffer.

While `console.status()` runs, Rich replaces `sys.stdout` and `sys.stderr` with a
`FileProxy` that holds text until it meets a newline. `Live` puts the original
streams back **without flushing that buffer**: a partial line written by a library
stays there, and is printed only when the interpreter finalises the object, at a
point where importing is no longer possible:

    Exception ignored while finalizing file <rich.file_proxy.FileProxy object …>
    ImportError: sys.meta_path is None, Python is likely shutting down

A successful scan therefore ends in a traceback, and whoever is watching has no
way of knowing the result was valid. Observed on APKRadar with rich 15.0.0 and
Python 3.14.7; here the spinner wraps the three collectors, which speak over the
network.

The test runs in a subprocess because finalisation is the thing being measured,
and inside pytest's own process it would never happen. It needs a `Console` that
believes it is a terminal: Rich installs the proxy only in that case, which is why
the defect cannot be seen through a pipe.

    """The path the docstring of `_status` claims to cover and did not.

    `console.file.flush()` sat after the `with console.status(...)` block rather
    than in a `finally`, so an exception leaving the body skipped it — and that is
    the path where a library's partial line matters most, because it is the run
    that is about to print a traceback. SonarCloud's python:S9152 found it
    ("Cleanup after this yield may be skipped on early exit"); no test did,
    because every test exercised the success path.

    `console.status` is replaced with a no-op for the duration, and that is the
    whole point of the test rather than a convenience. The first version of it did
    not do this, and passed against the broken code: Rich's own `Live.stop()`
    writes to the console on its way out, which flushes `console.file` as a side
    effect, so the recorder saw a flush that `_status` never performed. A test that
    cannot fail is worse than no test, and only replacing the spinner leaves this
    module's own flush as the only thing that could have done it.

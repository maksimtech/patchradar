"""How this Radar is numbered, and when it is allowed to move.

Five tools ship together and they are numbered the way Apple numbers a suite:
iOS 26, macOS 26, watchOS 26 share the generation and nothing else. The year is
the generation; the number after it belongs to this Radar alone and counts its
own releases. Two Radar being at 2026.10 and 2026.33 in the same week is the
scheme working, not a drift.

The rule that matters most is the one that is easiest to break by being tidy:
**a Radar that has not changed does not get a version.** Apple does not ship
watchOS 26.1 to keep iOS 26.1 company. On 2026-09-26 this project nearly
published five versions of which one — mailradar — was byte-identical to what
was already public, for no reason beyond making the numbers line up. The last
test here is that mistake, written down.

The month left the version when the scheme changed. It used to sit in the
second segment, which is why the numbering could not simply continue: under
PEP 440, `2026.4` is *lower* than `2026.9.3`, so the two Radar whose count was
below ten started again at ten rather than going backwards on PyPI.

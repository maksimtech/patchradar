"""EPSS where CVE ids already exist: the gate's own alerts.

Point four of the FIRST work was "EPSS in the other Radar", and EPSS is indexed by
CVE. Measured on 2026-10-02, exeradar carries no CVE ids at all and apkradar,
mailradar and cookieradar one incidental mention each — so there was nothing for it
to attach to, and inventing a CVE surface to justify a forecast would be the wrong
way round.

There is one surface that already exists, in all five, and we have spent two days
feeding it: `SECURITY-EXCEPTIONS.toml` and the code-scanning alerts it answers.
Docker Scout names its alerts by CVE, so the gate is holding CVE ids already —
`CVE-2026-95619`, `CVE-2026-102010`, `CVE-2026-85091` — with a written reason and a
review date against each.

A forecast is what those records were missing. "No fix available in any suite" is
an acceptance whose cost depends entirely on whether anybody is likely to use the
flaw: zlib's CVE-2026-85091 accepted until December is comfortable at an EPSS of
0.1% and is something else at 40%. The number does not decide; it is what a person
reads before renewing a review date.

Three rules the tests hold:

**The forecast never changes the verdict.** The gate fails on a blocking alert
with no entry and on an entry past its date, and on nothing else. An unreachable
EPSS, a CVE FIRST does not score, a 90% probability on an accepted finding: none of
them turns a pass into a failure. The gate is about the record.

**Only ids that are CVE ids are looked up.** `SNYK-DEBIAN13-GCC14-20386241` is not
a CVE and is not sent to FIRST as one, even though its description names a CVE —
reading the id is reading what the scanner said, and parsing prose is guessing.

**An absent score is absent.** FIRST not scoring a CVE and FIRST being unreachable
are different silences, and neither is a zero: 0.0 is a real reading at the floor
of the scale, where tens of thousands of CVEs sit.

"""Where the law cache goes when the environment says so.

Snyk flags four lines here as path traversal: PACKAGE_HOME flows into a path
that is then written, renamed and unlinked. As a vulnerability that does not
hold — the variable is set by whoever runs the tool, against their own files,
with their own privileges — but looking at why it was flagged turned up three
ways the value is taken literally when it should not be:

- "~/cache" makes a directory actually named "~", because Path() does not
  expand it. Anyone writing that in a Dockerfile ENV or a quoted shell
  assignment gets it.
- a relative path is resolved against the current working directory, so the
  cache lands somewhere different depending on where the command was run from
  — and quietly stops being one cache.
- "   " is truthy, so whitespace becomes a directory name.

None of those is an attack. All three are a cache that is not where the
operator meant it to be, which is exactly what a cache must not be.

"""
PatchRadar — a green pipeline must mean a clean product.

On 2026-09-28 every workflow was green while SonarCloud's quality gate was red
and thirteen high-severity alerts were open in code scanning. Nothing was
broken: `snyk.yml` carries `continue-on-error` by design so a pull request is not
blocked by pre-existing findings, and Sonar evaluates its gate after the job has
already succeeded. The result is a pipeline that reports and never refuses.

This is the gate that refuses. Its rule is the one that can be defended:

    block on everything we can fix; never block on an upstream flaw with no fix
    available — but require a dated, written reason for each one.

That is stricter than "wait until it is fixed", not laxer. Waiting on
`CVE-2026-85091` in Debian's zlib, which upstream marks "not fixed", means never
releasing our own fixes again; and an unexplained finding that nobody has to
justify is how thirteen of them came to be open without anyone deciding.

Three ways to fail, and the third is the one that keeps the file honest:

  - an open high or critical alert with no exception covering it;
  - an exception whose review date has passed;
  - an exception that no longer matches anything, so the file stops describing
    the product.

# reported CVE-2026-82560 against all five Radar, then stopped reporting it
# against exeradar at 15:08 — GitHub marked that alert `state: fixed`, nobody
# having dismissed it. The published image had not changed. patchradar and
# mailradar carry the same CVE both open *and* closed: it had already gone and
# come back once, on 2026-09-28.
#
# So a scanner dropping a finding for one run is not evidence that the finding is
# gone, and the first version of this tool failed the build for it — then failed
# it again, for "unexplained", once the entry was deleted and Scout changed its
# mind back. An oscillation that demands alternating commits is worse than no
# rule at all, because the way out is to stop reading the output.
#

# matching an alert that is closed describes something real that was reported
# recently; an entry matching nothing in any state is drift, and that is what the

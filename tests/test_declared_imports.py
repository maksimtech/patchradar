"""Every third-party module the tests import is either declared, or optional.

Written after the case that motivates it. Three of the five Radar had tests
doing `import yaml` while nothing in pyproject.toml asked for PyYAML: it arrived
through mutmut -> libcst, unasked and unnoticed. On 2026-09-25 libcst began
requiring pyyaml-ft, the free-threading fork, on Python 3.13 alone — so the
module `yaml` existed on 3.11, 3.12 and 3.14 and not on 3.13, and two Radar went
red on one matrix entry for a package neither of them had ever mentioned.

A borrowed dependency works until its lender changes its mind, and the lender is
under no obligation to say so. Hence a test rather than a note.

The rule is not "never import what you do not declare". apkradar reaches into
`loguru` on purpose — it belongs to androguard, and silencing androguard's
logger means touching it — and that is fine, because the test that does it says
`pytest.importorskip("loguru")` first and therefore skips rather than breaks if
it ever goes away. The rule is: what you do not declare, the suite has to
survive the loss of. `import yaml` did not.

Modules are resolved to the distributions that actually provide them rather than
guessed at from the name — `yaml` comes from PyYAML — so there is no map here to
keep in step with anything.

"""What the report says when a law could not be verified.

A missing SHA-256 is not a defect in the hashing: it is the honest consequence
of having no verified text to hash. Printing one anyway would assert a
verification that never happened.

But the reader has to be able to reach that conclusion from the report alone.
Before this, the warning said only "text not verifiable" at the top, while
"SHA256: not available" appeared further down against each citation, and
nothing connected the two — so a missing hash read as a bug in the tool.

Verified on 2026-09-24 against a real cache: every one of the 56 cached
provisions had a hash, and every cited reference was produced by the parser.
The gap was never in the computation.

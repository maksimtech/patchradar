"""Output must survive a console that is not UTF-8.

On Windows the console code page is cp1252 unless something changes it, and
Python encodes its output with it. The CLI help string carries an emoji, so
`--help` — a command that does nothing — ended in:

    UnicodeEncodeError: 'charmap' codec can't encode character '\\U0001f4e1'

The command was not failing; printing its output was. Every entry point was
affected, so nothing could run without PYTHONIOENCODING=utf-8 set by hand.

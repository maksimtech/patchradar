PatchRadar — local cache of EU law provisions.

Stored in ~/.patchradar/law_cache.json (or $PATCHRADAR_HOME/law_cache.json):

    {
      "checked_at": "2026-10-01T09:30:00Z",
      "entries": [
        {"article": "32(1)(a)", "text": "...", "sha256": "...",

      ]
    }

An entry keeps the fetched_at of the first download of its wording: an audit
that finds the same text on EUR-Lex only updates checked_at, so the version
date in reports changes only when the law text does. Entries are keyed by
(celex, article), since article numbers repeat across acts.
